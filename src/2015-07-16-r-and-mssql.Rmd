As I know, there are few choices to connect from R to MS SQL Server:

1. [RODBC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/index.html)
2. [RJDBC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJDBC/index.html)
3. [rsqlserver](https://github.com/agstudy/rsqlserver)

But only second option can be used on **mac** and **linux** machines. Here is nice [stackoverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14513224/connecting-to-ms-sql-server-from-r-on-mac-linux).

Most of the people suggest to use [microsoft sql java driver](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=11774). But there is a case when this will not help - **windows domain authentification**. In this situation I found the only working solution is to use nice [jTDS](http://jtds.sourceforge.net/). It not only solve this problem, but also [outperform](http://jtds.sourceforge.net/benchTest.html) Microsoft JDBC Driver.

So to use it you have to:

1. Install [rJava](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/). There are a lot of manuals for diffrent OS on the internet.
2. Install [RJDBC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJDBC/).
3. Download jTDS from [official site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtds/files/). Unpack it.

Now you can easily connect to your source:  
*(assume jtds-1.3.1, which is unpacked into ~/bin )*

```{r, eval=FALSE}
drv <- JDBC("net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver" , 
            "~/bin/jtds-1.3.1-dist/jtds-1.3.1.jar")
mssql_addr <- "10.0.0.1"
mssql_port <- "1433"
domain <- "YOUR_DOMAIN"
connection_string <- paste0("jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://", mssql_addr, ":", mssql_port, 
                            ";domain=", domain)
conn <- dbConnect(drv, 
                  connection_string, 
                  user = 'user_name', 
                  password = "********")
query <- "select count(*) from your_db.dbo.your_table"
cnt <- dbGetQuery(conn = conn, statement = query)
```
